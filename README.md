# Volume Control Using Hand Gestures 🖐️🔊

## Overview 🌟

Volume Control Using Hand Gestures is a Python-based application that lets users control system volume through intuitive hand gestures. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning, the tool provides a touch-free way to manage audio levels.

## Features 🚀

- **Gesture Recognition**:
  - Adjust volume by moving your hand in specific patterns.
  - Smooth and responsive real-time control.

- **User-Friendly**:
  - Simple interface with instant feedback on recognized gestures.

- **Device Compatibility**:
  - Works across platforms with webcam access.

## Technology Stack 🛠️

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**: For capturing and processing video input.
- **Mediapipe**: For detecting and tracking hand landmarks.
- **PyCaw**: To control system volume.
